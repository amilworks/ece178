# Contributing to ECE 178 Class Notes

## Get Involved

There are many ways to contribute to ECE 178, and many of them do not involve writing any code. Here's a few ideas to get started:

- Simply start using ECE 178. Go through the [Getting Started](https://amilworks.io/docs/) guide. Does everything work as expected? If not, we're always looking for improvements. Let us know by [opening an issue](#issues).
- Look through the [open issues](https://github.com/amilworks/ece178/issues). Provide workarounds, ask for clarification, or suggest labels. Help [triage issues](#triaging-issues-and-pull-requests).
- If you find an issue you would like to fix, [open a pull request](#pull-requests). Issues tagged as [_Good first issue_](https://github.com/amilworks/ece178/labels/Good%20first%20issue) are a good place to get started.
- Read through the [ECE 178 docs](https://ece178.io/docs/installation). If you find anything that is confusing or can be improved, you can click "Edit this page" at the bottom of most docs, which takes you to the GitHub interface to make and propose changes.
- Take a look at the [features requested](https://github.com/amilworks/ece178/labels/feature) by others in the community and consider opening a pull request if you see something you want to work on.


### Triaging Issues and Pull Requests

One great way you can contribute to the project without writing any code is to help triage issues and pull requests as they come in.

- Ask for more information if you believe the issue does not provide all the details required to solve it.
- Suggest [labels](https://github.com/amilworks/ece178/labels) that can help categorize issues.
- Flag issues that are stale or that should be closed.
- Ask for test plans and review code.
