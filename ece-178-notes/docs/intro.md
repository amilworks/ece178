# Start Here

> This is **Digital Image and Video Processing** taught at UCSB's Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. 

## Why am I writing this

I should probably be focusing on my research, but students in the class have asked for my notes, as well as some of the algorithmic implementations I have presented using `Python`. 

These notes are *very* rough and my goal is mainly for students to better understand the topic. If these notes help you, I would love to hear about it! __Throw a :star: on the GitHub repo!__

## Where is the content from

Literally everywhere. Mostly Pradeep Sen's lecture slides, combined with the classic book, Digital Image Processing by R. C. Gonzalez & R. E. Woods[^1]. I highly recommend you read that book to supplement what I am showing here. My notes will be terse compared to that book. I will try to find nice images on Wikipedia or make my own to showcase some of the concepts.

## Who am I

My name is Amil Khan[^2], and I am a PhD student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at UC Santa Barbara. I am also a TA for this Winter 2024 course.
