# Spatial Filtering and Digital Convolution

> Point wise operations vs spatial filtering

## Introduction

Spatial filtering encompasses a range of operations applied directly to the pixel values in an image's spatial domain, manipulating image content to enhance features or suppress noise. This procedure utilizes a predefined matrix, termed a kernel or filter, to systematically alter each pixel's intensity by considering its neighborhood.

The convolution operation, pivotal in spatial filtering, involves overlaying the kernel onto the image and computing the sum of element-wise products, assigning the result to the corresponding central pixel. This process iterates across the entire image, effectively transforming the pixel matrix based on the characteristics encoded in the kernel, leading to effects such as blurring, sharpening, edge detection, and more. 

In contrast to point operations, which remap pixel values independently, spatial filtering via convolution considers the contextual interplay of adjacent pixel values, offering nuanced control over the resultant image transformation.

## Convolution

The convolution operation is defined as the integral of the product of two functions, with one of the functions being reversed and shifted. In the context of image processing, the convolution of an image $f(x,y)$ with a kernel $h(x,y)$ is expressed as:

$$g(x,y) = f(x,y) \ast h(x,y) = \sum_{s=-a}^{a} \sum_{t=-b}^{b} h(s,t)f(x-s,y-t)$$

where $g(x,y)$ is the output image, $h(x,y)$ is the kernel, and $a$ and $b$ are the half-widths of the kernel in the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively.

The convolution operation is commutative, meaning that the order of the operands does not affect the result. However, in the context of image processing, the kernel is typically flipped both horizontally and vertically before the convolution operation, resulting in a process known as cross-correlation. This is due to the fact that the convolution operation is equivalent to the cross-correlation of the image with the flipped kernel.

## Types of Spatial Filtering

Spatial filtering encompasses a wide range of operations, each tailored to specific image processing tasks. The following are some of the most common spatial filtering techniques:

### Smoothing

Smoothing filters, also known as **low-pass filters**, are designed to reduce noise and detail in an image, resulting in a blurred appearance. The Gaussian filter is a popular choice for smoothing, as it applies a weighted average to the pixel values in the neighborhood, with the weights determined by a Gaussian function. This results in a smoothing effect that preserves edges and fine details.

This is defined as:

$$h(x,y) = \frac{1}{2\pi\sigma^2}e^{-\frac{x^2+y^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$

where $h(x,y)$ is the Gaussian kernel, and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the Gaussian function.

### Sharpening

Sharpening filters, also known as **high-pass filters**, are designed to enhance the edges and fine details in an image, resulting in a more pronounced appearance. The Laplacian filter is a popular choice for sharpening, as it highlights the high-frequency components of the image, effectively enhancing the edges and fine details.

### Edge Detection

Edge detection filters are designed to identify the boundaries between objects in an image, resulting in a binary representation of the edges. The Sobel filter is a popular choice for edge detection, as it computes the gradient of the image in the $x$ and $y$ directions, effectively highlighting the edges in the image.

The Sobel filter is defined as:

$$h_x = \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 & 1 \\ -2 & 0 & 2 \\ -1 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$$

$$h_y = \begin{bmatrix} -1 & -2 & -1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$$

where $h_x$ and $h_y$ are the Sobel kernels for the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively.



### Embossing

Embossing filters are designed to create a three-dimensional effect in an image, resulting in a raised or recessed appearance. The emboss filter is a popular choice for embossing, as it applies a directional kernel to the image, creating a three-dimensional effect.

### Custom Kernels

Custom kernels are designed to perform specific image processing tasks, such as blurring, sharpening, edge detection, and embossing. An example of a custom kernel is the unsharp mask, which is designed to enhance the edges and fine details in an image, resulting in a more pronounced appearance.


## The Bilateral Filter

We have discussed many filters that can be expressed as a convolution operation. However,  there exists a family of non-convolutional filters (non-linear kernels). Enter, the bilateral filter.

The bilateral filter is a non-linear, edge-preserving, and noise-reducing smoothing filter that is widely used in image processing. It is based on the concept of weighted averaging, where the weights are determined by both the spatial distance and the intensity difference between the pixels. This allows the bilateral filter to preserve the edges and fine details in an image, while reducing the noise and smoothing the overall appearance.

Traditional Gaussian filters are very useful, but only consider the differences in sample position. Hence, they are not very effective in preserving edges, as they tend to over-smooth the image. 

The bilateral filter is defined as:

$$
BF[I]_p = \frac{1}{W_p} \sum_{q \in \Omega} G_{\sigma_s}(\|p-q\|) G_{\sigma_r}(\|I_p-I_q\|) I_q
$$

where $BF[I]_p$ is the output image, $W_p$ is the normalization factor, $G_{\sigma_s}$ is the spatial Gaussian function, $G_{\sigma_r}$ is the intensity Gaussian function, and $\Omega$ is the neighborhood of the pixel $p$.

The weight $W(x,y)$ is determined by both the spatial distance and the intensity difference between the pixels, and is given by:

$$
W_p = \sum_{q \in \Omega} G_{\sigma_s}(\|p-q\|) G_{\sigma_r}(\|I_p-I_q\|)
$$

where $W_p$ is the weight, $G_{\sigma_s}$ is the spatial Gaussian function, $G_{\sigma_r}$ is the intensity Gaussian function, and $\Omega$ is the neighborhood of the pixel $p$.
