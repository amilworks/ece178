# Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)

> The slower Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) 

## Background

The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) transforms a discrete signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. The DFT is used to analyze the frequency content of a signal. 

In the **image processing context**, the DFT is used to analyze the frequency content of an image. The DFT of an image is a complex-valued function that represents the frequency content of the image. The **magnitude of the DFT** represents the amplitude of the frequency components, and the phase of the DFT represents the phase of the frequency components.

## The 2D Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) 

The **2D Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)** is defined as:

$$
F(u, v) = \sum_{x=0}^{M-1} \sum_{y=0}^{N-1} f(x, y) e^{-j2\pi(\frac{ux}{M} + \frac{vy}{N})}
$$

where $f(x, y)$ is the input image, $F(u, v)$ is the transformed image, and $M$ and $N$ are the dimensions of the image.

Given the transform $F(u,v)$, we can obtain $f(x,y)$ by using the inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT):

$$
f(x, y) = \frac{1}{MN} \sum_{u=0}^{M-1} \sum_{v=0}^{N-1} F(u, v) e^{j2\pi(\frac{ux}{M} + \frac{vy}{N})}
$$

These two equations constitute a 2D discrete Fourier transform pair, $f(x, y) \leftrightarrow F(u, v)$. The proof is as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
f(x, y) &= \frac{1}{MN} \sum_{u=0}^{M-1} \sum_{v=0}^{N-1} F(u, v) e^{j2\pi(\frac{ux}{M} + \frac{vy}{N})} \\
&= \frac{1}{MN} \sum_{u=0}^{M-1} \sum_{v=0}^{N-1} \left( \sum_{x=0}^{M-1} \sum_{y=0}^{N-1} f(x, y) e^{-j2\pi(\frac{ux}{M} + \frac{vy}{N})} \right) e^{j2\pi(\frac{ux}{M} + \frac{vy}{N})} \\
&= \frac{1}{MN} \sum_{x=0}^{M-1} \sum_{y=0}^{N-1} f(x, y) \left( \sum_{u=0}^{M-1} \sum_{v=0}^{N-1} e^{j2\pi(\frac{ux}{M} + \frac{vy}{N})} e^{-j2\pi(\frac{ux}{M} + \frac{vy}{N})} \right) \\
&= \frac{1}{MN} \sum_{x=0}^{M-1} \sum_{y=0}^{N-1} f(x, y) \\
&= f(x, y)
\end{align*}
$$

The proof for the inverse transform is similar. Does this make sense? Let me know if there are any mistakes and I will fix them.



## Proof of the 2D DFT

The proof of the 2D DFT is similar to the proof of the 1D DFT. We will use the 1D DFT to prove the 2D DFT. The 1D DFT is defined as:

$$
F(u) = \sum_{x=0}^{M-1} f(x) e^{-j2\pi\frac{ux}{M}}
$$

where $f(x)$ is the input signal, $F(u)$ is the transformed signal, and $M$ is the length of the signal. The inverse 1D DFT is defined as:

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{u=0}^{M-1} F(u) e^{j2\pi\frac{ux}{M}}
$$

The 2D DFT is defined as:

$$
F(u, v) = \sum_{x=0}^{M-1} \sum_{y=0}^{N-1} f(x, y) e^{-j2\pi(\frac{ux}{M} + \frac{vy}{N})}
$$

where $f(x, y)$ is the input image, $F(u, v)$ is the transformed image, and $M$ and $N$ are the dimensions of the image. The inverse 2D DFT is defined as:

$$
f(x, y) = \frac{1}{MN} \sum_{u=0}^{M-1} \sum_{v=0}^{N-1} F(u, v) e^{j2\pi(\frac{ux}{M} + \frac{vy}{N})}
$$

We can use the 1D DFT to prove the 2D DFT. We can express the 2D DFT as a sum of 1D DFTs:

$$
F(u, v) = \sum_{x=0}^{M-1} f(x, y) e^{-j2\pi\frac{ux}{M}} e^{-j2\pi\frac{vy}{N}}
$$

We can then use the 1D DFT to express the 2D DFT as a sum of 1D DFTs:

$$
F(u, v) = \sum_{x=0}^{M-1} \sum_{y=0}^{N-1} f(x, y) e^{-j2\pi\frac{ux}{M}} e^{-j2\pi\frac{vy}{N}}
$$

**QED** And this is the definition of the 2D DFT.
