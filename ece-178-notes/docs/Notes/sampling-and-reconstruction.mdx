# Sampling and Reconstruction

## Introduction to Sampling and Reconstruction

Sampling and reconstruction are fundamental concepts in communications and signal processing (my PhD emphasis in the ECE department). 

**Sampling** refers to the process of converting a continuous-time signal into a discrete-time signal by capturing its values at regular intervals. **Reconstruction**, on the other hand, involves converting a discrete-time signal back into a continuous-time signal. These processes are essential for **converting analog signals into digital form** and vice versa, enabling the representation, transmission, and processing of signals using digital systems.


## Sampling of analog signals in 1D


### Sampling by Dirac delta multiplication

$$
x_s(t) = x(t) \cdot \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(t - nT)
$$

where $x(t)$ is the original analog signal, $x_s(t)$ is the sampled signal, and $T$ is the sampling period. The Dirac delta function $\delta(t - nT)$ acts as a sampling gate, capturing the value of the signal at regular intervals of $T$.

### Sampling in the Fourier Domain

The Fourier transform of the sampled signal is given by:

$$
X_s(f) = X(f) * \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(f - n/T)
$$

where $X(f)$ is the Fourier transform of the original signal, and $X_s(f)$ is the Fourier transform of the sampled signal. The convolution of $X(f)$ with the Dirac comb function $\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(f - n/T)$ results in the replication of the original spectrum at intervals of $1/T$ in the frequency domain.

### Visualization of Sampling in the Frequency Domain

### How this works

- A sinusoidal function, $y = \sin(2\pi x)$, is used to generate the signal data.
- The `drawSubsampled` function (Check it out on GitHub if you are interested) generates data points for the signal based on the subsampling rate provided by the you the user through the slider. It then draws (or redraws) the line representing the subsampled signal.
- The slider input event triggers the `drawSubsampled` function, updating the visualization based on the selected subsampling rate.

This basic example demonstrates the effect of subsampling on a signal and how decreasing the sampling rate can lead to aliasing, visually represented by changes in the signal's appearance. Experiment with different rates to see how undersampling distorts the original sinusoidal shape. Sorry if this isn't the most beautiful graphic, I kind of suck at D3.js, well actually all things JavaScript.

### Shannon's Sampling Theorem (1949)

A function $x(t)$, band-limited to $B$ Hz, can be reconstructed exactly from its equidistant samples, provided that the sampling step is $T< \frac{\pi}{B}$.

Specifically, 

$$
x(t) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x(nT) \cdot \text{sinc}\left(\frac{t - nT}{T}\right)
$$

where $\text{sinc}(x) = \frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi x}$ is the sinc function.

The interpretation as a convolution is:

$$
x(t) = x_s(t) * \text{sinc}(\dfrac{t}{T})
$$

where $x_s(t)$ is the sampled signal.


Shannon's sampling theorem, also known as the **Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem**, provides a fundamental guideline for sampling continuous-time signals. The theorem states that a continuous-time signal $x(t)$ can be perfectly reconstructed from its samples if the sampling rate is at least twice the bandwidth of the signal. Mathematically, the sampling theorem can be expressed as:

$$
f_s \geq 2B
$$

where $f_s$ is the sampling frequency and $B$ is the bandwidth of the signal. The **bandwidth of a signal** is the range of frequencies that the signal contains. The sampling theorem ensures that no information is lost during the sampling process, allowing for accurate reconstruction of the original signal from its samples.


## Aliasing and Anti-Aliasing

### Spectral Replication, Aliasing
Convolving a comb function with the original spectrum results in the replication of the original spectrum at intervals of $1/T$ in the frequency domain. This phenomenon is known as **spectral replication** or **aliasing**. The replicated spectra can overlap with each other, leading to a phenomenon called **aliasing**. Aliasing can cause distortion and loss of information in the reconstructed signal, making it essential to avoid undersampling and ensure that the sampling theorem is satisfied.

### Avoid Aliasing

You can apply a pre-filter (ideal low-pass) to the original signal to remove the spectral replicas before sampling. This process is known as **anti-aliasing**. The anti-aliasing filter removes the high-frequency components from the signal, ensuring that the sampled signal does not contain spectral replicas that can cause aliasing. 




### Temporal and Spatial Aliasing

Aliasing is not limited to the frequency domain and can occur in the spatial domain as well. In the context of images, **temporal aliasing** refers to the distortion of moving objects in video frames, while **spatial aliasing** occurs when the resolution of an image is insufficient to represent fine details accurately. Both types of aliasing can be mitigated using anti-aliasing techniques, such as low-pass filtering and downsampling.

### The Wagon Wheel Effect

The wagon wheel effect is a classic example of temporal aliasing that occurs in movies and videos. When a spoked wheel rotates at a certain speed, it may appear to rotate in the opposite direction or stand still due to the frame rate of the camera. This phenomenon is a result of temporal aliasing and can be mitigated by increasing the frame rate or adjusting the shutter speed of the camera.

### Nyquist frequency

The Nyquist frequency is defined as half the sampling frequency and represents the maximum frequency that can be accurately represented in the sampled signal. Frequencies above the Nyquist frequency can cause aliasing and distortion in the reconstructed signal. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that the Nyquist frequency is greater than the highest frequency component of the original signal to avoid aliasing.

$$
f_N = \frac{f_s}{2}
$$

where $f_N$ is the Nyquist frequency and $f_s$ is the sampling frequency.

So for the wagon wheel effect, let's say that 1 revolution takes 180 ms. Then, the frequency is $f = \frac{1}{T} = \frac{1}{0.18} = 5.56 Hz$. If the frame rate is 24 fps, then the Nyquist frequency is $f_N = \frac{24}{2} = 12 Hz$. The wheel frequency is less than the Nyquist frequency, so the wheel should appear to rotate in the correct direction.

If the wheel has 6 spokes, then the wheel frequency is $f = 6 \times 5.56 = 33.33 Hz$, which is greater than the Nyquist frequency. The wheel will appear to rotate in the opposite direction. So the minimal acquisition frequency to avoid aliasing is $f_s = 2 \times 33.33 = 66.66 Hz$.


To combat spatial aliasing, the image resolution can be increased, or anti-aliasing filters can be applied to remove high-frequency components before downsampling. Hence, the solution is to use a low-pass pre-filter to remove the high-frequency components before downsampling.

## 2D Sampling and Conditions for Perfect Recovery

### Introduction to 2D Sampling

We are now interested in converting a continuous two-dimensional (2D) signal into a discrete set of samples. This process is crucial for storing, processing, and analyzing images digitally.

### Notation and 2D Sampling Function

So I am switching to a kind of more intuitive notation for images and sampling operations. Let $I(x, y)$ represent the continuous 2D signal, where $x$ and $y$ are spatial coordinates in the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively. The sampled 2D signal, $I_s[m, n]$, can then be defined as follows:

$$
I_s[m, n] = I(x, y) \cdot \sum_{p=-\infty}^{\infty} \sum_{q=-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(x - pM, y - qN)
$$

Here, $I_s[m, n]$ represents the discrete samples of the original continuous signal $I(x, y)$. The parameters $M$ and $N$ denote the sampling intervals along the $x$ and $y$ axes, respectively, and $\delta$ represents the Dirac delta function, which isolates individual samples at intervals of $M$ and $N$.

### Separability of the 2D Sampling Function

The 2D sampling process is inherently separable, implying that the 2D sampling operation can be decomposed into two independent one-dimensional (1D) sampling processes along each axis. This separability is mathematically represented by the outer product of two 1D sampling functions, simplifying both the conceptual understanding and computational implementation of 2D sampling.

### Condition for Perfect Recovery (The Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem)

For a 2D signal to be perfectly recoverable from its sampled version, it must satisfy the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem in both dimensions. This theorem states that a continuous signal can be completely reconstructed from its samples if it is band-limited and the sampling frequency is greater than twice the highest frequency present in the signal (the Nyquist rate).

Mathematically, if $f_x$ and $f_y$ are the highest frequencies in the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively, the conditions for perfect recovery are:

$$
M \leq \frac{1}{2f_x} \quad \text{and} \quad N \leq \frac{1}{2f_y}
$$

Where $M$ and $N$ are the sampling intervals in the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively. When these conditions are met, the original continuous signal $I(x, y)$ can be perfectly reconstructed from its sampled version $I_s[m, n]$ without any loss of information.

## **Homework.** Assignment Details

### Introduction to Downsampling and Aliasing

Downsampling is a process used to reduce the spatial resolution of an image by decreasing the number of pixels. This technique is widely used in image processing for various applications, including image compression and resizing. However, downsampling can introduce an undesired artifact known as aliasing. Aliasing occurs when high-frequency components in the image are improperly represented at a lower resolution, leading to visual distortions.

To mitigate the effects of aliasing, anti-aliasing methods such as filtering can be applied before downsampling. Filtering helps remove high-frequency content from the image, thereby reducing the likelihood of aliasing artifacts.

### Implementing `myDownSampling` Function

The `myDownSampling` function is a custom implementation to perform downsampling on an input image. This function requires the following parameters:

- `image`: The input image to be downsampled.
- `downsampling_rate`: The rate at which the image should be downsampled.
- `anti_aliasing_method`: A string indicating the anti-aliasing method to be applied. The options include 'No anti-aliasing', 'Box filter', and 'Gaussian'.

The function should return the downsampled image.

### Downsampling Methods

1. **No Anti-Aliasing**: This method performs direct downsampling without any preprocessing to remove high-frequency components. While simplest, it is most prone to aliasing artifacts.

2. **Box Filter Anti-Aliasing**: Before downsampling, the image is convolved with a box filter. The box filter, also known as an averaging filter, replaces each pixel value with the average of its neighbors. This process smooths the image, effectively reducing high-frequency content.

3. **Gaussian Anti-Aliasing**: This method involves convolving the image with a Gaussian filter before downsampling. The Gaussian filter applies a weighted average to each pixel, with weights decreasing with distance from the center pixel. This results in a smoother and more natural reduction of high frequencies compared to the box filter.

### Implementation Details

- **Nearest Neighbor Downsampling**: For all methods, downsampling can be performed using the nearest neighbor approach, where the output pixel is assigned the value of the closest pixel in the input image based on the downsampling rate.

- **Filter Convolution**: For box filter and Gaussian anti-aliasing methods, convolution operations must be implemented manually, as the use of built-in functions like `conv2` and `fspecial` is restricted. Convolution involves sliding the filter over the image and computing the sum of element-wise multiplications at each position.

- **Filter Design**:
    - The box filter can be designed as a matrix of ones normalized by the filter's area, ensuring that the sum of the filter coefficients is 1.
    - The Gaussian filter requires calculating the Gaussian function values based on the desired standard deviation, ensuring the filter coefficients are normalized.

Don't worry, I will discuss more below.


### Observing Aliasing Effects

After implementing the `myDownSampling` function with the specified anti-aliasing methods, you are encouraged to experiment with different downsampling rates and observe the aliasing effects. Comparing the results of different anti-aliasing methods provides insight into their effectiveness in preserving image quality during downsampling.


## **Implementation.** So yeah, let's conquer this aliasing thing...

### Step 1: Create the Gaussian Kernel

The Gaussian kernel is defined by the formula:

$$
G(x, y) = \frac{1}{2\pi\sigma^2}e^{-\frac{x^2 + y^2}{2\sigma^2}}
$$

where $ \sigma $ is the standard deviation of the distribution, and $x$ and $y$ are distances from the kernel's center.

:::tip
If you know Python well, then check out the implementation of the `scipy.ndimage.gaussian_filter` function. It is a good example of how to implement a Gaussian filter in Python. Same with the `scipy.ndimage.convolve` function. This is one of those *standing on the shoulders of giants* learning experiences us programmers need to do more often.
:::

### Step 2: Convolve the Image with the Gaussian Kernel

As you already know at this point, **Convolution** involves sliding the kernel over the image and computing the sum of element-wise multiplications at each position.

Here's how you can implement these steps in Python using NumPy:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def gaussian_kernel(size, sigma=1):
    """Generates a 2D Gaussian kernel."""
    size = int(size) // 2
    x, y = np.mgrid[-size:size+1, -size:size+1]
    normal = 1 / (2.0 * np.pi * sigma**2)
    g = np.exp(-((x**2 + y**2) / (2.0*sigma**2))) * normal
    return g

def convolve(image, kernel):
    """Convolves an image with a kernel."""
    kernel_height, kernel_width = kernel.shape
    image_height, image_width = image.shape
    
    # Calculate the padding size
    pad_height = kernel_height // 2
    pad_width = kernel_width // 2
    
    # Pad the image
    padded_image = np.pad(image, ((pad_height, pad_height), (pad_width, pad_width)), mode='constant', constant_values=0)
    
    # Prepare the output array
    output = np.zeros_like(image)
    
    # Perform the convolution
    for x in range(image_height):
        for y in range(image_width):
            # Element-wise multiplication and sum
            output[x, y] = np.sum(kernel * padded_image[x:x+kernel_height, y:y+kernel_width])
    
    return output

def gaussian_filter(image, kernel_size=5, sigma=1):
    """Applies a Gaussian filter to an image."""
    kernel = gaussian_kernel(kernel_size, sigma)
    return convolve(image, kernel)

# Example usage
image = plt.imread('path_to_your_image.png')  # Ensure this is grayscale
blurred_image = gaussian_filter(image, kernel_size=5, sigma=1)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1), plt.imshow(image, cmap='gray'), plt.title('Original')
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2), plt.imshow(blurred_image, cmap='gray'), plt.title('Blurred with Gaussian Filter')
plt.show()
```

#### Explanation

- **Gaussian Kernel Generation**: The `gaussian_kernel` function creates a 2D Gaussian kernel based on the specified size and $ \sigma $. The kernel weights decrease with distance from the center, following the Gaussian distribution.

- **Convolution Function**: The `convolve` function slides the Gaussian kernel over the image, applying the Gaussian smoothing effect. This function manually implements the convolution process, highlighting the computational steps involved in filtering.

- **Gaussian Filter Application**: The `gaussian_filter` function combines the kernel generation and convolution steps to apply Gaussian smoothing to an input image.

- **Box Filter** The box_filter function is a simple implementation of an averaging (box) filter that you can use for anti-aliasing. It creates a uniform kernel and uses the convolve function to apply it to the image. I defined this in the next section.



### Putting it all together

Befoore we get into the whole implementation, let's draw attention to some important concepts we discussed in Friday's section.


- **Aliasing in Images:** By downsampling without applying an anti-aliasing filter (`else statement`), high-frequency components that cannot be represented at the lower resolution may cause visual artifacts. This illustrates the concept of aliasing.

- **Anti-Aliasing with Box Filter:**  By averaging nearby pixels before downsampling (`Box`), we reduce the high-frequency components that are prone to aliasing, thus mitigating its effects.

- **Anti-Aliasing with Gaussian Filter:** Applying a Gaussian filter (`Gaussian`) smooths the image more naturally, as it weights pixels based on their distance, effectively reducing high-frequency content that leads to aliasing.

```python
import numpy as np

def box_filter(image, kernel_size=5):
    """Applies a box filter (average filter) to an image."""
    kernel = np.ones((kernel_size, kernel_size)) / (kernel_size ** 2)
    return convolve(image, kernel)


def myDownSampling(image, downsampling_rate, anti_aliasing_method):
    """
    Downsample an image with optional anti-aliasing using custom filters.
    
    Args:
    - image (numpy.ndarray): The input image to downsample.
    - downsampling_rate (int): The rate at which to downsample the image.
    - anti_aliasing_method (str): The anti-aliasing method to use ( 'Box', 'Gaussian').

    Returns:
    - numpy.ndarray: The downsampled image.
    """
    
    if anti_aliasing_method == 'Box':
        # Apply your implemented box filter
        image_filtered = box_filter(image, kernel_size=5)
    elif anti_aliasing_method == 'Gaussian':
        # Apply your implemented Gaussian filter
        image_filtered = gaussian_filter(image, kernel_size=5, sigma=1)
    else:
        # No anti-aliasing applied
        image_filtered = image

    # Perform nearest neighbor downsampling
    downsampled_image = image_filtered[::downsampling_rate, ::downsampling_rate]
    
    return downsampled_image
    ```

So is this a complete and correct implementation for the `myDownSampling` function? Well, not quite. Because you need to implement this in `MATLAB` and I am unsure of the syntax and the functions you can use. This is also my implementation and I may have missed something. Read the assignment thoroughly and make sure you are aware of the parameters such as what function not to use. Nonetheless, I hope this gives you a good idea of how to implement the function in `MATLAB`? Maybe? I hope so.



## Quiz 

### Understanding Aliasing with the Wagon Wheel Effect

#### Question

 Consider a wagon wheel rotating at a rate such that it completes one full revolution every 100 milliseconds. If a camera captures this wheel at a frame rate of 30 frames per second (fps), will the wheel appear to rotate in the correct direction, in the opposite direction, or appear stationary due to aliasing?


#### Explanation

 The frequency of the wagon wheel's rotation can be calculated as $f = \frac{1}{T} = \frac{1}{0.1} = 10 \,Hz$, where $T = 0.1 \,s$ is the time it takes for one revolution. Given that the camera's frame rate is 30 fps, the Nyquist frequency is $f_N = \frac{f_s}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \,Hz$. Since the wheel's rotation frequency $f = 10 \,Hz$ is less than the Nyquist frequency $f_N = 15 \,Hz$, the wheel should appear to rotate in the correct direction in the captured video, as the sampling frequency is sufficient to accurately capture the wheel's motion without aliasing.

#### Follow-up Question

 If the wheel has 8 spokes, and each spoke is considered to contribute to the effective rotation frequency seen by the camera, what is the minimal acquisition frame rate required to avoid the aliasing effect?


#### Explanation

 With 8 spokes, the effective frequency seen by the camera becomes $f_{\text{effective}} = 8 \times 10 \,Hz = 80 \,Hz$, as each spoke passing in front of the camera can be considered an event contributing to the observed frequency. To avoid aliasing, the sampling frequency ($f_s$) must be at least twice the highest frequency component, according to the Nyquist theorem. Therefore, $f_s \geq 2 \times 80 = 160 \,Hz$, which corresponds to a frame rate of $160 \,fps$.
