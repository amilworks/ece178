# Spatial Filtering and Digital Convolution

> Point wise operations vs spatial filtering

## Introduction

Spatial filtering encompasses a range of operations applied directly to the pixel values in an image's spatial domain, manipulating image content to enhance features or suppress noise. This procedure utilizes a predefined matrix, termed a kernel or filter, to systematically alter each pixel's intensity by considering its neighborhood.

The convolution operation, pivotal in spatial filtering, involves overlaying the kernel onto the image and computing the sum of element-wise products, assigning the result to the corresponding central pixel. This process iterates across the entire image, effectively transforming the pixel matrix based on the characteristics encoded in the kernel, leading to effects such as blurring, sharpening, edge detection, and more. 

In contrast to point operations, which remap pixel values independently, spatial filtering via convolution considers the contextual interplay of adjacent pixel values, offering nuanced control over the resultant image transformation.
